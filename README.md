# Visualizing weeks lived as average human

It was originally a CodePen project which was later converted to a hosted website. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/deepak_kharah/pen/rNrYbOW](https://codepen.io/deepak_kharah/pen/rNrYbOW).

Inspired by the book Four Thousand Weeks: Time and How to Use It, I have built a simple visualizer that showcases how much time an average human would spend on this planet.

This book has an interesting take on time management. It shows that you have limited time in this world and force you to think about how you would like to spend this time.
